  "raw_test_response": "Hello! I'd be happy to provide a sample response demonstrating how I would handle a dispute de-escalation request.\n\nHowever, I should clarify that I'm the **Dispute De-escalation Agent** - I don't interact directly with customers. I only process internal requests from the Dispute Orchestrator.\n\nTo provide a recommendation, I need to receive a request in this format:\n\n```\nINTERNAL_DEESCALATION_REQUEST\nTransaction ID: [id]\nAmount: [amount]\nCustomer Description: [description]\nFraud Assessment: Low probability\n```\n\n---\n\n**Here's a sample of how I would respond to a valid request:**\n\nIf I received:\n```\nINTERNAL_DEESCALATION_REQUEST\nTransaction ID: TXN-789456\nAmount: $125\nCustomer Description: Customer says they ordered a jacket online but received the wrong size. Merchant is not responding to refund requests.\nFraud Assessment: Low probability\n```\n\nMy response would be:\n\n```\nINTERNAL_DEESCALATION_RESPONSE\ncontainment_strategy: Strategy 2 - Partial Credit\noffer_details: 50% credit ($62.50) on $125 disputed transaction\ncustomer_message: I understand your frustration with the merchant not responding to your refund request. While we can't reverse the charge directly since it was an authorized purchase, I can offer you a $62.50 credit as a goodwill gesture to help resolve this situation.\napproval_required: false\napproval_level: auto\nestimated_success_rate: 60%\nreasoning: Amount $125 falls within the $50-$500 range. This is a merchant dispute involving product quality/fulfillment issue (wrong item received). Strategy 2 criteria met - offering 50% partial credit which is within auto-approval threshold ($125 < $200).\n```\n\n---\n\nPlease send me a properly formatted internal request to receive a tailored recommendation.",
